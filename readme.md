A small example of how to achieve full screen splash screen for most API versions 

Small note:
for the APIs < 21, make sure to scale down your .png (I forgot to do so :c) and generate the xhdpi, xxhdpi, xxxhdpi, I recommend doing that by using this tool: https://pypi.org/project/android-asset-generator/
